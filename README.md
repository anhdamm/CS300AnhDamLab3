# Lab 3 - Composed 3D transformations, matrix stack, keyboard functions.

- Create an object that composes of at least 10 3-D analytical objects.
  - Use matrix stack operation - push/pop  
- All transformations must be controlled through keyboard interaction
  - Use the arrow keyboard to rotate object in direction
  - Use the alphabet keyboard to exit window, move object in up/down direction
- Create a sun that automatically rotates counter-clockwise
